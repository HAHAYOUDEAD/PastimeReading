## Adding Books

1. Head to [Gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
2. Search for a book in the `Quick search` box OR by clicking `Search and Browse` > `Advanced Search` and typing in your query.
# See end of README for an example
3. In the Mods folder open up the folder titled `pastimeReading`
4. Open up `book.txt` in an editor tool such as `Notepad++, Sublime, or even plain old Notepad`
5. Read this very carefully otherwise your book may look weird!
6. Copy/paste your book and be sure to format correctly.
7. Enjoy your book within The Long Dark!

## Example

1. I want to add Call of the Wild so in the search field, I am going to type `Call of the Wild`
2. I'm then going to click on the book `The Call of the Wild by Jack London`
3. Click on the `Plain Text UTF-8` and copy everything.

# Important
Make sure it is one that has a graphic and not an audio icon

4. When formatting your book remember that `book.txt` said the first line is the `Book Title` and the second line is the `Authors Name`. So that means for this book you would have the `book.txt` formatted like so.
